Problem 10

Here in problem 03 designers identified the three structures (H01, H21, H79) should be evacuated
permanently because those structures have been located within the proposed highway trace. For
selecting the lands to re-locate, designers used criteria as follows.

Lands should be selected within the intersection area of minimum bounding circle of all religious
places and minimum bounding circle of all schools. Hence designers want to show the intersection
area visually.

       St_minimumboundingcircle(St_union(location)) AS MinimumBoundingCircle
FROM   structure
WHERE  type = 'Religious Place'
        OR type = 'School'
GROUP  BY type;
